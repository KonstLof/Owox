Overview of toggling options.
=============================

First of all the data should be updated once a week on Wednesday 08:00 to be safe that GA
has processed all data. The earliest data is the preceding Sunday.

Date options:
-------------
    ● Last week (Mon-Sun)
    ● Last 2 weeks
    ● Last 4 weeks
    ● Last 12 weeks
    ● Last 24 weeks
    ● Last month
    ● This month (1st till the preceding Sunday of the data load)
    ● 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th Quarter
    ● This year
    ● Lifetime

The deltas (comparison period) on the graph should be in the following logic:
----------
    ● Weeks are compared to the previous mirror period:
    - for last week in april 8-14 is compared to 1st - 7th april
    - for last 12 weeks 1apr-23jun is compared to 7jan-31mar
    ● Last month March is compared to February
    ● This month is compared to the same period last month
    ● 2019Q2 is compared to 2019Q1 - Quarter to the previous quarter
    ● This year 2020 1jan-29feb is compared to 2019 1nov-31dec
    ● Lifetime - no comparison
